Multiple-Boundary Clustering and Prioritization


This repository stores our experimental codes and part of the datasets.

Part of the datasets lies in the folder: adv. Because some of our simulated test datasets exceed GitHub's file size limit of 100.00 MB, we can only upload part of our datasets in file 'data/mnist'.

The main experimental codes are 
samedist_mnist_retrain.py, 
samedist_cifar_retrain.py, 
samedist_svhn_retrain.py. 
You can modify the list variables 'baselines' and 'operators' to run what you prefer.
